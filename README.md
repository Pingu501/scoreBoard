# Tamburello Score Board

Goal is to build a light and foldable scoreboard for tamburello using an arduino. This scoreboard will be driven by a USB powerbank.

Feel free to join us!

## Status

First working version is online on [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dDkwn3E02NM#/) so the next step is to get all parts!

## Stuff needed

- Arduino (Uno R3)
- 4x button (next for team A and B, undo and reset)
- 8x 7-segment displays (self made from led stripes)
- 8x 7-segmnet controller (CD4511 used on tinkercad)
- 4x 8-bit shift registers (74HC595 used on tinkercad)

## Next Steps

- rewrite code to enable the back button (some kind of event history maybe?)
- make a plan how to build this in the real world
- Buy parts and stick them together

Feel free to modify this project as you want to build your own :)
